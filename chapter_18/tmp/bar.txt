I'd like to go to a bar
But it's far too far
Hardy Har Har 
I'm a master of all trades
And a slave to no woahman
I'ma gonna be a davinci coder
Coding my davinci code bro. 
Don't you know? 
I'm a Riley Man
Living the life of Jones
I've got it in my bones
Run away from Riley Jones, quick!
He smells too good.
