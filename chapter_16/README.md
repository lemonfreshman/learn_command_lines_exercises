As you'll learn in this chapter, * (asterisk) allows you to specify more than one file at a time.

Alternative "english" ways of using the asterisk:

> Can you output all the txt files in this directory?

cat *.txt
text hello
bye man
text hello
bye man


> Show me the content of the text files in slash temp.
mv *.txt tmp
cd tmp
cat *.txt

text hello
bye man
text hello
bye man

>The use of of the asterisk * in terminal allows one to select multiple files 
>as long as everything except the * in the filename matches the input
