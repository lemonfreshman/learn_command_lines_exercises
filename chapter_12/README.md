As you'll learn in this chapter, less and more allow you to view the contents of files.




Alternative english ways of asking for your working directory:


Can we see what's in our production log?

less production.log
[displays file here] in new window 



What does our database.yml look like?

less database.yml 
[displays file here] in new windo 


In the new window that 'less' brings us to we can go up and with w and the spacebar.
