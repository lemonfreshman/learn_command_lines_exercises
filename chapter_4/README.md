As you'll learn in this chapter, mkdir (make directory) allows you to create sub-directories.
Please note, usually in class when we talk about Temporary directories ("temp dir"), we are referring to tmp, not temp (notice the missing "e").
Alternative "english" ways of asking you to create a directory:


1.) Can you make a temp directory?

>mkdir temp
>but no I can't make a tmp

2.) Can you make a log directory in your 
class directory?


>mkdir ../../log
