As you'll learn in this chapter, ls (list directory) shows you what files are in your current directory.
Alternative "english" ways of asking for a list of files:

>What's in the tmp directory?

ls /tmp 

>Can you show me what files are in that directory?

cd stuff
ls 
things 

>What files are in your home directory?

ls /

Applications, Desktop, Documents, etc....



What's in slash temp?
ls /tmp
