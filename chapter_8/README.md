As you'll learn in this chapter, pushd (push directory)
 and popd (pop directory) allows you to move around the filesystem.
These commands can make you faster at switching directories, 
but are not something you would use on a day to day basis.
I very rarely use these commands

pushd takes you to the directory you entered 
popd makes you go back to the first directory 


pushd stuff/things/frank/joe/alex/john
~john
popd 
~stuff
