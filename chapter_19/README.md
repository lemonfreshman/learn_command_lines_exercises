As you'll learn in this chapter, man provides you with information about commands.

Alternative "english" ways of asking for your working directory:

>What option to ls tells it to output file size in human readable form?

ls -h 

>Is there a case insensitive option to grep?

Yes, it's grep -i 

>What does the -r and -f options to rm do exactly?


rm -f removes a file and ignores permissions and doesn't give a message back
 to the command line so it's forcing the file to be removed. So one would only 
 use it when one is very sure that one wants to remove the file in question. 



>What does the ifconfig command do?

It configures network interfaces with various parameters.
