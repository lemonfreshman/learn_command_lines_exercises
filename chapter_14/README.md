As you'll learn in this chapter, rm (remove) simply removes a file.
Alternative english ways of asking for your working directory:



>Can you remove blah.txt?

touch blah.txt
blah.txt
rm blah.txt
ls 
foo development.log


>Let's get rid of our development log file.

touch development.log 
development.log
rm development.log
ls 
foo

>Can you remove everything in the slash temp slash foo directory?

no
you have to individually remove all files 

rm tmp/foo/deleteme.txt
ls tmp/foo
