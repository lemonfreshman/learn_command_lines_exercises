As you'll learn in this chapter, changing your environment variables can be useful.
Alternative "english" ways of asking you to export some stuff:



Can you set the debug environment variable to true?


$ export DEBUG=true
$env
DEBUG=true


Can you remove the debug environment variable?
$ unset DEBUG
$ env | grep DEBUG
