As you'll learn in this chapter, touch (touch/create empty file) will 
create a new empty file. Windows power shell does not have this command so the New-Item command is used.
Alternative "english" ways of asking you to create a file:



>Can you touch blah.txt?

Yes. 

touch blah.txt
ls 
blah.txt



>Let's create foo.txt.

touch foo.txt
ls 
foo.txt
