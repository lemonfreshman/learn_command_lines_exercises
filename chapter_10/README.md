As you'll learn in this chapter, cp (copy) allows you to create a copy of an existing file.
Alternative "english" ways of asking you to copy a file:



Can you copy the foo.txt file to slash temp? (Create foo.txt first...)

echo > foo.text
cp foo.txt /temp


Can you copy .bash_profile in your home directory to the current directory?


cp .bash_profi
