As you'll learn in this chapter, cd (change directory) allows you to change your present working directory.

Note that Linux/OSX uses /, while Windows uses \\.  In "english" I will simply say slash, you should remember which slash you should use.

Alternative "english" ways of asking you to change directories:

> Can you cd into the temp directory?

cd tmp
Now we are in the temp directory 


> Why don't we go into the temp directory?

We are already in it. 
I'll go back out

cd ..


> Can you go to the slash temp directory?

cd /tmp

 Yes. 
 
> Can you go to the slash temp slash log directory?

cd /tmp/log

Yes

>W hat does the .. argument to cd do?  Explain it in the Readme.md.
 
cd .. sends you into the directory that is one level up. 



DO MORE:

1. cd temp/stuff/things/frank/joe
2. cd ../../../..
3. cd, cd by itself takes you to the home directory 
4. cd documents
5. cd downloads, cd desktop
